# GeoVista: Spatial-Temporal Trajectory Visualization Platform
Welcome to GeoVista, a dynamic project at the intersection of geospatial data analytics and visualization. We have successfully implemented essential functionalities for handling moving object trajectories using Apache Sedona, a powerful spatial data library. We have introduced a user-friendly front-end interface and an API to seamlessly interact with the underlying Apache Sedona project.

Key Components:
Front-End Interface:
The user-friendly interface that empower users to input parameters for trajectory-related tasks seamlessly.
Options for loading datasets, defining spatial and spatiotemporal range queries, and specifying KNN queries will be incorporated into a clean and intuitive design.

Trajectory Visualization:
Leveraging the powerful Trips layer from deck.gl or pydeck, GeoVista will provide users with a visually rich representation of moving object trajectories.
Real-time visualization ensures that users can dynamically explore and interpret the outcomes of their queries.

API Integration:
The front-end interface will communicate with the underlying Phase-1 Apache Sedona project through a meticulously designed API.
The API will facilitate the transfer of inputs and outputs between the user interface and the geospatial processing engine.

Technology Integration: Utilized Apache Sedona, an open-source library for geospatial analytics, to process and analyze large-scale spatial datasets efficiently. Integrated Deck.gl, a WebGL-powered framework, for advanced data visualization in the browser.
